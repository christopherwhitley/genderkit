In the UK, people who are changing things linked to gender are supported by a set of specialist centres, often known as "gender identity clinics" (GICs), which offer [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) and access to other services like hormone medications and surgeries. 

You can find information about what clinics are available to you, their waiting times, and which services will see you more quickly on [the TransActual website](https://transactual.org.uk/medical-transition/gender-dysphoria-clinics/). 

There are instructions on how to access NHS services on [the TransActual website](https://transactual.org.uk/medical-transition/).

There are also some private services which you can access, and details of this service are also on [the TransActual website](https://transactual.org.uk/medical-transition/private-care/).

### How much will it cost?

*British citizens* are able to access the NHS and HSC gender services for *free*. If you are not a British citizen, you may still be able to access these services for free, and more details can be found on the [Immigration page]({% link _resources/immigration.md %}).

Patients in Wales being referred to gender services for children and young people will need to ask their GP to apply for funding from their local Health Board.
