### Screening tests

During your life the NHS will invite you to a number of screening tests for common conditions. As the prevalence of these conditions is different for men and women, some tests only invite people who have "female" on their NHS record, and some tests only invite people who have "male" on their NHS record. This can mean people who have changed their gender marker can invited to the wrong tests for the body parts they have.

If you change your NHS gender marker, you should remember that you may not receive reminders for the tests you need, and may have to ask for them yourself. You can read more about screening tests and which tests you might need:

- on the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-information-for-transgender-people/nhs-population-screening-information-for-trans-people)
- on the [NHS Wales website](https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/cervical-screening-wales/information-resources/transgender-information/screening-information-for-people-who-are-transgender-non-binary-gender-diverse/)
- and on the [Cancer Research UK website](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/screening/trans-and-non-binary-cancer-screening)
